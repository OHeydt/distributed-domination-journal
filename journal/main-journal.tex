Let $D$ be a minimum dominating set (of size $\gamma$) of a graph $G$. 

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:neighborhood-dom1}
Let $G$ be a graph. Then there are less than $\gamma(G)$ vertices $v\in V(G)\setminus D$ with the property that $N(v)$ cannot be dominated by at most $2\nabla_1(G)$ vertices different from $v$.
\end{lemma}
