  We show that the dominating set problem admits a constant factor
  approximation in a constant number of rounds in the \mbox{LOCAL}
  model of distributed computing on graph classes with bounded
  \mbox{expansion}.  This generalizes a result of Czygrinow et al.\
  for graphs with excluded topological minors to very general classes
  of uniformly sparse graphs.  We demonstrate how our general
  algorithm can be modified and fine-tuned to compute an
  ($11+\e$)\hspace{1pt}\raisebox{0.3pt}{-}\hspace{0.9pt}approximation
  (for any $\epsilon>0)$ of a minimum dominating set on planar
  graphs. This improves on the previously best known approximation
  factor of~52 on planar graphs, which was achieved by an elegant and
  simple algorithm of Lenzen et al.
