We show that the dominating set problem admits a constant factor
approximation in a constant number of rounds in the \mbox{LOCAL} model
of distributed computing on graph classes with bounded \mbox{expansion}.
This generalizes a result of Czygrinow et al.\ for graphs with excluded
topological minors.
