\section{Conclusion}

We simplified the presentation and generalized the algorithm of Czygrinow et al.~\cite{czygrinow2018distributed} from graph classes that exclude
some topological minor to graph classes~$\mathcal{C}$ where
$\nabla_1(G)$ is bounded
by an absolute constant for all $G\in \mathcal{C}$. This is a property
in particular possessed by classes with bounded expansion, which include
many commonly studied sparse graph classes.

It is an interesting and important question to identify the most
general graph classes on which certain algorithmic techniques work.
The key arguments of \cref{lem:neighborhood-dom1} and \cref{lem:neighborhood-dom2} work only for classes with~$\nabla_1(G)$ bounded by an absolute constant. We need different methods
to push towards classes with only $\nabla_0(G)$ bounded,
which are the degenerate classes.

The obtained bounds are still large,
but by magnitudes smaller than those obtained in the original work of
Czygrinow et al.\cite{czygrinow2018distributed}. It will also be
interesting to optimize the algorithm for planar graphs, where additional
topological arguments can help to strongly optimize constants and
potentially beat the currently best known bound of 52~\cite{lenzen2013distributed,wawrzyniak2014strengthened}.
