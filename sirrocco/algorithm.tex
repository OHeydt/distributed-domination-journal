\section{The algorithm}

In this final section we summarize the algorithm.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Compute the set $D_1$ of all $v$ such that $N(v)$ cannot be
dominated by $2\nabla_1(G)$ vertices different from $v$.
Remove $D_1$ from $G$ and mark all its neighbors as dominated.
\item In parallel for every vertex $v=v_1$ compute all $k$-domination
sequences $v_1,\ldots, v_s$. Add all vertices $v_s$ to the set
$D_2$. Remove $D_2$ from $G$ and mark its neighbors as
dominated. This is done as follows.

We can learn the
neighborhood $N_2[v]$ for every vertex $v$ in $2$ rounds.
In the LOCAL model we can then compute the pseudo-covers
without further communication. In two additional rounds can
compute the domination sequences from the pseudo-covers
(as we need to consider only elements from $N_2[v_1]$).
We report in $2$ additional rounds that $v_s$ belongs to $D_2$
and one more round to mark the neighbors of~$D_2$ as
dominated.
\item In the final round we add all non-dominated vertices to a set $D_3$
and return the set $D_1\cup D_2\cup D_3$.
\end{enumerate}

According to \cref{lem:neighborhood-dom1},
\cref{lem:small-D-hat}
  and \cref{crl:d3}
  the algorithm computes a $2+  3(2k)^{t(2k+1)}+k^{t-1}(2t-1+(t-1)q)$
  approximation. This is an absolute constant in
  $\mathcal{O}(\nabla_1^{4t\nabla_1+t})$ depending only on $\nabla_1(G)$,
  as also $t<2\nabla_1$.
